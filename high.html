  <h1>Jamie's Part of the Story</h1>
  <hr>
  <div class="story">
    <p class="story-description">Jamie grew up in San Francisco in a wealthy family. <br>His mother was a successful
      lawyer and his father a renowned microbiologist. They always lived in the best neighborhoods in the country and as
      soon as Jaime turned 18, his parents got him into his dream university and later into a career as a lobbyist
      through their connections and positions. <br>After a few years, he decided to write a book about his resounding
      success stating that "anyone with the will can do what I did". He explained that social justice and its
      inequalities were for those who still believed in it.
