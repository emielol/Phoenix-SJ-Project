    <h1>THE PHOENIXSJ PROJECT</h1>
    <p>The Phoenix Social Justice project concentrates on the prominent economic and legal inequality throughout the
      world. Others will gain insight into the conditions of people. Below we have a selection of three different
      characters that are from different socio-economic classes.

    <h3 id="intro-story">One day, in a coffee shop, three authors of different economic status were sitting around a
      table discussing economic equality. At the table were Jaime Stanney, Zuri Kalaney and Joe Harper.

    <div id="description">
      <p>Economic inequality refers to the unequal distribution of income and opportunity among different social groups.
        It is a global problem and many people are trapped in poverty with very few opportunities to move up the social
        ladder and live a better life, but we are not the only ones who acknowlege the danger of this issue. There are a
        multitude of organizations that fight against poverty and advocate for financial reform. </p>

            <p>RESULTS is a social effort of passionate people. They use their collective voices to influence political
              decisions that will end poverty. Volunteers are trained, supported, and inspired to become proactive.
              Volunteers eventually learn to effectively advise policymakers, guiding them toward decisions that improve
              access to education and economic opportunity. These organizations enable people to make a difference in
              their community by banding together, contacting state legislators, and organizing advocacy events. You,
              too, can get involved and make a difference.</p>
