# Phoenix-SJ-Project
The PhoenixSJ Project gives users insight to what is is like to live and grow up in the three different parts of the socio-economic levels: low class, middle class, and higher class. This project also provides people with resources to volunteer to anti-poverty and anti-homeless groups to make their own impact.

How we built it
We researched the factors of economic inequality and how it individually affects each class. Each character was based on these classes. Afterwards, we searched for groups that took solving this issue a step further and created organizations.

Challenges we ran into
We had a great deal of difficulty making things easier for us to code as beginners. We were trying to combine Python and HTML, but due to the lack of familiarity with frameworks, it was a challenge. Therefore, we decided to go in a different direction and we built our final project.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we created something that has a purpose including helping society and raising awareness on issues in social justice.

What we learned
We learned that we should focus more on managing our time.

What's next for PhoenixSJ Project
Next, we will improve the project to where it performs on a larger scale and contains much more implementations.
