  <h1>Joe's Part of the Story</h1>
  <hr>

  <div class="story">
    <p class="story-description">During this confrontation, the last writer sits, listening to everything and every word exchanged. Quietly, he prepares to leave. Joe has not been as blessed as Jaime or Zuri to have always been financially stable. Despite all their struggles they never had to sleep on the cold street barefooted. Jaime sees him leave and asks him what his story is that makes him so arrogant. That's when he told them his story. <br>Joe grew up in a dysfunctional family, his father was a gambler and his mother was a hairdresser. There were 7 children and he was the oldest. When he was 12 years old, he had to get a job because his parents were heavily in debt to shady people and the bank. He hoped from job to job but it was never enough. <br>One day he made the greatest mistake of his life and was arrested for transporting illegal substances. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison. After they were served, he was released and became homeless for another decade before telling his story. <br>For him, economic inequality is the icing on the cake of many other problems in our society. <br>Who do you agree with?</p>
