  <h1>Zuri's Part of the Story</h1>
<hr>
  <div class="story">
    <p class="story-description">Against Jaime's views was Zuri Kalaney, a publicist for a local agency. She grew up middle class for most of her life, until she left home. <br>In recent years, she was a single mother trying to support herself and her child while living through the time of price inflation. <br>Jaime's words have frustrated her immensely, as her greatest motivation in life is to give her son the stability she grew up with, but she finds herself struggling. <br>She wonders if she will ever be able to buy a house or pay for her child's post-secondary education.
